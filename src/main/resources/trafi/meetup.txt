Analyzing Trafi Data with Apache Spark,Zeppelin and d3.js 
=============================================================

We will continue our big data journey with hands-on workshop.
Workshop will cover a basic workflow from the raw data to valuable
information using the tools mentioned in invitation. 
 
Our final goal is to calculate approximation of passenger cars carboon emissions per town

Calculation is based on population size, odeometer readings and cars emisssions.
